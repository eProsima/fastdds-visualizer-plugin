======================

.. figure:: /rst/figures/black_screen_windows.png
    :align: center


it is likely because an incompatibility between the OpenGL version used in
PlotJuggler and the latest versions of Windows. To solve this problem, go to Preferences:

.. figure:: /rst/figures/black_screen_windows_preferences.png
